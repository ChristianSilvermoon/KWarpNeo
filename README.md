# KWarpNeo
Datapack for Minecraft that adds a Multiplayer-friendly warping system. 

It's great for things like Minecraft Realms, where you'd really like a good fast travel system, but can't use server plugins or mods.

## Installation
Place the folder corresponding to your Minecraft Version into your world's `datapacks` directory.

Preferably name it "KWarpNeo_version"

Then run `/reload` or re-open your Minecraft World.

## Getting Started

To get started, you first need to craft a "Book of Warping". To do that, drop an Ender Pearl and a Book onto an Enchanting Table.

Once you have the Book of Warping, you can save coordinates, buy warps and warp removers, and use all of these things for the listed cost of Levels.

## Warning

Do ***NOT*** place a warp before saving coordinates for the first time! Doing so will point your warp to `0 0 0`, which will drop you and anything else that enters your portal into the void, meaning death.
